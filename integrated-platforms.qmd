### What is Version Control?

Imagine you're writing a research paper. You make changes, save different versions, and sometimes want to go back to previous versions. Version control is like having a time machine for your files - it helps you track changes, collaborate with others, and maintain a history of your work.

Git was made by Linus Torvalds, the same person who made Linux! It is like a super-powered save system. Instead of saving files with names like `paper_FINAL_final_UPDATED_NEW.docx`, `proj_NEW_LASTEST.R`, Git keeps track of all changes automatically.

#### Basic Git Concepts & Commands

- **Repository (Repo)**: Think of it as a project folder that Git watches. Like a photo album that keeps track of all your project's versions. **Local repo** is a copy of the remote repo on your computer. **Remote repo** can be the version stored on GitHub or GitLab.

- **Commit**: Like taking a snapshot of your work. Each commit is a saved point you can return to. Like saving a checkpoint in a video game or giving your file a name/version.

</div>

- **Branch**: Like creating a parallel universe for your work. You can experiment without affecting the main project. Like writing a draft of your paper without changing the original. Also can be used to collaborate with others, simultaneously working on the same project! You can **Merge** your changes back to the main branch after you are done. Master branch is the main branch of the repo (recently renamed to main).

```bash
# Start a new project (create a new repository)
git init

# Check the status of your files
git status

# Add files to be saved (staging)
git add filename.txt    # Add specific file
git add .              # Add all files

# Save your changes (commit)
git commit -m "Description of changes"

# See your project history
git log

# Create and switch to a new branch
git checkout -b new-branch-name

# Switch between branches
git checkout branch-name

# Get updates from remote repository
git pull

# Send your changes to remote repository
git push

# Reset your branch to the latest commit
git reset --hard
```

### GitHub: Your Project's Home on the Internet

![GitHub vs Bitbucket vs GitLab](./images/github.jpg)

GitHub is like a social network for your code. It's where you can:
- Store your projects online
- Collaborate with others
- Share your work with the world

#### Key GitHub Features

1. **Repository Hosting**
   - Like a cloud storage specifically for code
   - Access your projects from anywhere

2. **Issue Tracking**
   - Like a to-do list for your project
   - Track bugs and feature requests

3. **Pull Requests**
   - Like suggesting changes to someone else's work
   - Request to merge your changes into their project

4. **Code Review**
   - Like peer review for your code
   - Get feedback before changes are merged

### Common GitHub Workflow

1. **Fork a Repository**
   - Like making a copy of someone else's project
   - You can modify it without affecting the original

2. **Clone a Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
   ```
   - Like downloading a project to your computer

3. **Push Changes**
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```
   - Like uploading your changes to GitHub

### Best Practices

1. **Write Clear Commit Messages**
   - Like writing good notes
   - Helps others (and yourself) understand changes

2. **Create Feature Branches**
   - Like working on a separate draft
   - Keeps your main work clean

3. **Regular Updates**
   - Like syncing your phone
   - Keep your local copy up to date

4. **Review Before Committing**
   - Like proofreading before submitting
   - Check your changes before saving

### Common Scenarios

1. **Starting a New Project**
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```

2. **Updating Your Work**
   ```bash
   git pull
   # Make changes
   git add .
   git commit -m "Description of changes"
   git push
   ```

3. **Collaborating with Others**
   ```bash
   git pull
   # Resolve any conflicts
   git add .
   git commit -m "Resolved conflicts"
   git push
   ```

### Tips for Beginners

1. **Start Small**
   - Begin with basic commands
   - Practice with simple projects

2. **Use Visual Tools**
   - GitHub Desktop
   - GitKraken
   - VS Code's Git integration

3. **Learn from Mistakes**
   - Git keeps history
   - You can always go back

4. **Ask for Help**
   - GitHub has great documentation
   - Many online communities can help

Remember: Git and GitHub are tools that get easier with practice. Don't worry if it seems complex at first - even experienced developers use only a small subset of commands regularly.
