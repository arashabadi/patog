# Single-Cell Analysis

Welcome to the Single-Cell Analysis chapter of the PATOG Book.

## What is Single-Cell Analysis?

Single-cell analysis is a powerful approach in genomics that allows researchers to study individual cells, revealing cellular heterogeneity and providing insights into cell types, states, and interactions that would be masked in bulk analysis.

## Key Topics

- Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq)
- Single-cell ATAC sequencing (scATAC-seq)
- Single-cell proteomics
- Spatial transcriptomics
- Cell type identification
- Trajectory analysis
- Cell-cell communication
- Integration of multi-omics data
