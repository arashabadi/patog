# Git Fundamentals

## Introduction to Git

Git is a distributed version control system that helps track changes in source code during software development. It's designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files.

## Core Concepts

- Repository
- Commit
- Branch
- Merge
- Remote

## Basic Git Commands

```bash
# Initialize a new repository
git init

# Clone a repository
git clone <repository-url>

# Check status
git status

# Add files to staging
git add <file>
git add .

# Commit changes
git commit -m "commit message"

# Create and switch to a new branch
git checkout -b <branch-name>

# Switch branches
git checkout <branch-name>

# Merge branches
git merge <branch-name>
```

## Best Practices

- Write clear commit messages
- Create feature branches for new work
- Keep commits atomic and focused
- Regularly pull from remote
- Review changes before committing
